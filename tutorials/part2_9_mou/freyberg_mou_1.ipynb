    "# Introduction to constrained multi-objective management optimization (under uncertainty)\n",
    "\n",
    "### yeah, its getting deep!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two PESTPP-OPT notebooks, we introduced the concept of constrained management optimization under uncertainty.  We saw standard risk-neutral optimization and then piled on the learning and concepts with the idea of chances, chance constraints, risk/reliability, and stacks.  So if you are reading this notebook...\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so now let's talk about the nature of constraints and objective functions.  In the Freyberg example, we have been treating the sw-gw exchange flux and the aggregate groundwater extraction rate for each stress period as a \"hard\" inequality constraint: thou shall not violate! But in many settings there is a general stakeholder preference to avoid unwanted outcomes but the exact nature of that avoidance is not known: \"Sure we want to keep some groundwater flowing into the surface-water system but we also want have plenty of water to drink\".  Very imprecise...so how can we deal with this is science nerds?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, one way is to use so-called \"multi-objective\" optimization, where the goal is to map the trade off between competing objectives. Unfortunately, this kind of trade-off mapping is very (very) computationally expensive because in most cases, we have to resort to \"global\" evolutionary-type algorithms.  Note that \"multi-objective\" doesnt mean go crazy with objectives.  Five or six is probably the most that be used for algorithmic reasons.  \n",

    "`PESTPP-MOU` implements a constrained multiple and single objective \"global\" optimization using evolutionary algorithms.  Additional terminology alert!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - \"individual\": an optimization problem candidate solution. So just a decision variable vector - one value for each decision variable\n",
    " - \"population\":  well, a collection of individuals\n",
    " - \"generation\": a complete cycle of the evolutionary algorithm (think \"iteration\"), which involves generating a new, \"child\" population by combining parents, evaluting the children's fitness (running the population thru the model), and the (natural) selection, where the \"best\" individuals from the parent and child population are keep.  No doubt \"best\" is where things get complicated...\n",
    " - \"generator\":  the algorithmic process to generate a child population.  Differential evolution is the default in PESTPP-MOU but there are others\n",
    " - \"selector\": the algorithmic process to pick the best individuals in the population to move to the next generation.  For single objective formulations, this is trivial. For multiobjective formulations, selection is also complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there you have it - you are now ready for PESTPP-MOU! but wait, how big should the population be?  How many generations should I use?  Great questions!  Generally it is said that the population should be about twice as large as the number of decision variables.  As for generations, lots (and this is the problem!).  Like 50, 100, or more are not uncommon...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for some important aspects of using PESTPP-MOU in (heavily) constrained formulations.  As we will see below, it is important to make sure at least a few individuals in the initial population are (nearly) feasible.  This helps greatly.  And we know that extracting less groundwater will result in the sw-gw exchange constraints being satisfied.  So lets generate an initial population ourselves using pyEMU with lower decision variable upper bounds and then feed that to PESTPP-MOU (and reset the upper bound to a larger value).  Conceptually, we want to explore using larger pumping rates but we want to do that from within the feasible region so that PESTPP-MOU can maintain a (largely) feasible population."
