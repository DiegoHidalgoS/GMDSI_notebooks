    "# Introduction to constrained multi-objective management optimization (under uncertainty)\n",
    "\n",
    "### yeah, its getting deep!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two PESTPP-OPT notebooks, we introduced the concept of constrained management optimization under uncertainty.  We saw standard risk-neutral optimization and then piled on the learning and concepts with the idea of chances, chance constraints, risk/reliability, and stacks.  So if you are reading this notebook...\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so now let's talk about the nature of constraints and objective functions.  In the Freyberg example, we have been treating the sw-gw exchange flux and the aggregate groundwater extraction rate for each stress period as a \"hard\" inequality constraint: thou shall not violate! But in many settings there is a general stakeholder preference to avoid unwanted outcomes but the exact nature of that avoidance is not known: \"Sure we want to keep some groundwater flowing into the surface-water system but we also want have plenty of water to drink\".  Very imprecise...so how can we deal with this is science nerds?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, one way is to use so-called \"multi-objective\" optimization, where the goal is to map the trade off between competing objectives. Unfortunately, this kind of trade-off mapping is very (very) computationally expensive because in most cases, we have to resort to \"global\" evolutionary-type algorithms.  Note that \"multi-objective\" doesnt mean go crazy with objectives.  Five or six is probably the most that be used for algorithmic reasons.  \n",

    "If you are intersted in learning more about multi-objective optimization, #LMGTFY: \"pareto frontier\", \"pareto dominance\", \"nsga-II\", etc...\n"
