    "It is very common to want to restart PESTPP-IES using existing results.  The most common reason is to evaluate the prior parameter ensemble - that is, to run the prior through the model and check the simulated results for coherence and common sense.  Once you are happy with (or not completely unhappy with) the prior results, you might then want to try a small number of iterations with PESTPP-IES.  If your model runs fast, then you can just fire off PESTPP-IES again just as before but with `noptmax` greater than 0.  But if your model takes a while, it can be costly to re-run the prior parameter ensemble again.  In this case, you can easily restart PESTPP-IES with the existing ensemble files.  In this notebook, we will demonstrate this workflow.  We note that while we will focus on restarting with the prior ensemble results, PESTPP-IES can be restarted from any previous PESTPP-IES result files\n"

    " - simulated output ensemble (iteration specific), option name: `ies_restart_observation_ensemble`\n",
    " \n",
    "The parameter ensemble and simulated output ensembles must be from the same iteration but PESTPP-IES has no way of knowing this, so its up to you not to mess this up!  In the current example, we want to restart with the prior ensemble results, so the files we seek are \"<case_name>.0.par.csv\" and \"<case>.0.obs.csv\" for the parameter and simulated ensemble files respectively (note that if you are using binary formats, the files would end with \".jcb\" instead of \".csv\").  \n",
